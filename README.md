This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

This is a "clicking" game created with React.js:

* The user must click on each character image until their score reaches 9.
* Each time a character is clicked its id is added to an array to keep track of the characters the user has already clicked.
* Each time a character is clicked, all the character images are shuffled.
* If the user has already clicked on a character, they lose the game and the game is reset.
* If the user clicks on all 9 characters without clicking on the same on twice, they win the game.
